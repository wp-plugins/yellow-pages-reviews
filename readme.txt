2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it! You should now be able to use the widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the widget look funny in my theme? =

Most likely your theme has conflicting CSS that is interfering with the themes included with the plugin. If you're handy with CSS this can be an easy fix. If you are new to CSS then try out the Bare Bones theme to see if that looks nicer. Otherwise, you may have to hit up your coding friends to help you out.

= Are style (CSS) and/or theme compatibility issues supported? =

We do our best to support the free version of the plugin, but theme conflicts are not our top priority. Premium plugin support is where we spend most of our support time. If you are experiencing a style issue and need help, either upgrade to the Premium version or post in the WordPress.org support forum and we will do our best to get it set up nicely with your theme.

= Are there prebuilt styles included in the plugin? =

Yes, there are three basic themes included in the free version of the plugin. The premium version has many more options and themes.
